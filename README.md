##  Jonas Martins - Building the Future, One *SegmentationFault* at a Time


Welcome!  I'm Jonas Martins (@jonasxmartins), a Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto.  Here you will find my coding experiences and other stuff!  _Spoiler: I do not know how to center a div._

**Experiences & Interests:**

A glimpse into the tools I have wielded. These are the few I am most proud of:

*  **Algorithm Design:** ü™Ñ Constraint Satisfaction, Informed Search, Adversarial Search, Bayesian Networks
*  **Statistical Modelling:**  Hypothesis Testing, Linear Regression
*  **Data/Signal Processing:**  Audio Processing, Financial Data Processing, CSV Parsing 
*  **Machine Learning:**  ANNs, CNNs for classification and regression
*  **Hardware Programming:**  FPGAs with Verilog and C
*  **Operating Systems:** ‚öôÔ∏è C for emulating several functionalities of Linux architecture.
*  **Computer Networks:**  Sockets, Wireshark Packet Sniffing, Analysis of protocols and IP layers. 

**Beyond the Code:**

I am passionate about history, economics, and political science, and have written several essays:

*  **Institutional Roots of Apartheid in South Africa**
*  **Realism vs Liberalism in International Relations**
*  **On the Role of Policy-Making in Social Education**
